# Eventify — Featured Events Webpage

## Overview
This is a modern, responsive single-page web application showcasing featured events with dynamic data rendering and live search functionality. The project demonstrates core web development skills using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**, focusing on practical frontend development with a real-world internship-style scenario.

---

## Technologies & Tools Used

- **HTML5** — Semantic markup and page structure  
- **CSS3** — Custom styling using Flexbox, CSS Grid, and media queries for full responsiveness  
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** — DOM manipulation, event handling, dynamic content rendering, and live search filtering  
- **VS Code** — Development environment with extensions for debugging, syntax highlighting, and code completion.

---

## Features

- **Dynamic Event Loading:**  
  Events are stored as a JSON object in the script and dynamically rendered as event cards on page load.

- **Live Search Filter:**  
  A search input filters events by their name in real time (case-insensitive), improving user experience.

- **Responsive Design:**  
  Layout adapts seamlessly across devices — mobile (1-column), tablet (2-columns), desktop (3-columns).

- **Clean & Intuitive UI:**  
  Includes a hero section with centered messaging and a navbar with responsive hamburger menu (planned for future).

## How to Run the Project

1. **Clone or download** the repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
3. The page will load the events dynamically and allow you to use the search bar immediately.
4. No server or build tools are required — fully static and client-side.
